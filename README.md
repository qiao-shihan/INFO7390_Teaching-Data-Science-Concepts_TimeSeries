# 📘 Time Series Forecasting Teaching Module  
### Using ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM for S&P 500 Forecasting  
**Author:** Shihan Qiao  
**Course:** INFO 7390 – Advanced Data Science  
**Purpose:** Teaching Module + Final Project

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete instructional module that teaches three major paradigms of time-series forecasting:

1. **ARIMA** – classical statistical modeling  
2. **Prophet** – trend/seasonality decomposition  
3. **LSTM** – nonlinear deep learning sequence modeling  

The project is designed as a **progressive, hands-on learning experience** for graduate students.  
It includes conceptual explanations, mathematical deep dives, implementation analysis, debugging guidance, visual examples, and structured exercises.

This module serves both as a **teaching resource** and a **technical demonstration** of forecasting on the S&P 500 index using real market data (2020–2024).
